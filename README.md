<b>This repository contains machine learning project:</b>

## Regression
Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction
<p>This is a house sales price prediction using different machine learning prediction model. Every
regression model here is trained on same above dataset. After training all the model Random Forest
Regression Model has the highest r2_score.</p>

1. Multiple Linear Regression
2. Polynomial Regression
3. Simple Vector Regression
4. Decision Tree Regression
5. Random Forest Regression

## Classification
Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/kandij/diabetes-dataset

<p>This is a Diabetes Prediction dataset where there are different features like insulin level, 
blood pressure, etc. which helps to classify whether a person is diabetic or not. Here we have 
taken AUC(Area Under the Cueve) for accuracy.</p>

1. Logistic Regression
2. K-Nearest Neighbour
3. Simple Vector Machine
4. Kernel SVM
5. Naive Bayes Classifier
6. Decision Tree Classifier
7. Random Forest Classifier
